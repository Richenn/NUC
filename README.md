Non-uniformity correction algorithms (DDE algorithms of infrared images are on the way!)

1st. The non-uniformity correction algorithm based on registration is proposed. The experimental results show that when the field of view moves rapidly,the proposed method can remove the striped nonuniformity noise without producing the visible ghost phenomenon.

2nd. The algorithm based on the random number is proposed to remove the spatial low frequency and high-frequency non-uniformity noise in the scene.This method constructs the expectation function from random arrays thus the algorithm has extremely low complexity and can be processed in real time. Experimental results show that compared with other methods, this method can <<remove>> spatial low-frequency nonuniformity noise such as <<"pot cover" noise>>.

3rd. The correction algorithm based on a neural network is proposed. The judgment mechanism of algorithm convergence is introduced and a smoothing function is designed to <<eliminate ghosting>>. Compared with other non-uniformity correction algorithms based on scene time-domain iteration, this algorithm can achieve non-uniformity correction under the static and slow motion of the field of view without introducing ghosts.

4th. The nonuniformity correction strategy based on deep learning is studied. The limitations of the hardware platform and the loss of accuracy during model conversion lead to poor performance after porting the algorithm.
